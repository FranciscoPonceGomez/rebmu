	Type: dialect
	Level: advanced
	
	Usage: { The Rebmu language is a dialect of Rebol which uses some unusual tricks to
	achieve smaller character counts in source code.  The goal is to make it easier to
	participate in programming challenges where the goal is to achieve a given task in as few
	characters as possible.
	
	There is the obvious need to come up with abbreviations for long words like WH instead of 
	WHILE.  Rebol is particularly good at allowing one to do this kind of thing within the
	language and without a preprocessor.  But a more novel piece of trickery that Rebmu uses
	is the alternations of uppercase and lowercase letters to compress words in the source.  
	This central to the Rebmu concept of "mushing" and "unmushing":

		>> unmush [abcDEFghi]
		== [abc def ghi]

	The choice to start a sequence of alternations with an uppercase letter is used as a special
	indicator of wishing the first element in the sequence to be interpreted as a set-word:
	
		>> unmush [ABCdefGHI]
		== [abc: def ghi]
	
	This applies to elements of paths as well.	Each path break presents an opportunity for
	a new alternation sequence, hence a set-word split:
	
		>> unmush [ABCdef/GHI]	  
		== [abc: def/ghi:]

		>> unmush [ABCdef/ghi]
		== [abc: def/ghi]

	An exception to this rule are literal words, where since you cannot make a literal
	set-word in source the purpose is to allow you to indicate whether the *next* word
	should be a set-word.  Choosing lowercase for the lit word will mean the next word
	is a set-word, while uppercase means it will not be:
	
		>> unmush [abc'DEFghi]
		== [abc 'def ghi]

		>> unmush [abc'defGHI] 
		== [abc 'def ghi:]
	
	Because symbols do not have a "case" they are handled specially.  Since Rebmu tries
	to be compatible with Rebol code (as long as it's all lowercase!) they generally
	act like lowercase letters, with a few caveats:
	
		[a+b] => [a+b] 		; lowercase run to another lowercase, will act lowercase
		[+b] => [+b] 		; implied lowercase
		[A+B] => [a+b:] 	; uppercase run to another uppercase, will act uppercase!
		[a+B] => [a+ b] 	; switching lower to upper, plus binds to the tail of first
		[A+b] => [a: + b] 	; switching upper to lower, plus lives on its own!
		
		[a++b] => [a++b] 	; all one token
		[A++B] => [a++b:] 	; as expected
		[a++B] => [a ++ b] 	; surprise!  multiple symbols bind into their own token
		[A++b] => [A: ++ b] ; as above
	
	The number of spaces and colons this can save on in Rebol code is significant, and
	it is easy to read and write once the rules are understood.  If you know Rebol, that is :)
	
	Despite being a little bit "silly" (as Code Golf is sort of silly), there is
	a serious side to the design.  Rebmu is a genuine dialect... meaning that it
	uses the Rebol data format and thus relegates most parsing--such as parentheses
	and block matches.	This means that there's no string-oriented trickery taking
	advantage of illegal source token sequences in Rebol (like 1FOO, A:B, A$B...)
	
	Also, Rebmu is a superset of Rebol, so any Rebol code should be able to be used
	safely.	 That's because despite several shorthands defined for common Rebol operations 
	(even as far as I for IF) the functions are true to their Rebol bretheren across 
	all inputs that Rebol accepts.	[Current exceptions to this are q and ?]
	
	Rebmu programs get their own execution context.	 They will unmush their input,
	set up the environment of abbreviated routines, and run the code:
	
		>> rebmu [w"Hello World"]
		Hello World
		
	You can also pass in named arguments via a block:
	
		>> rebmu/args [wSwM] [s: "Hello" m: "World"]
		Hello
		World
	
	The argument block can even use Rebmu code and conventions, if you like :)

		>> rebmu/args [wSwM] [S"Hello"M"World"]
		Hello
		World	
	
	Or you can pass in a block which does not begin with a set-word and that block will
	appear in the execution context as the variable a:
	
		>> rebmu/args [wA] [1 2 3]
		1 2 3
	
	You can run your Rebmu program and let it set some values in its environment, such
	as defining functions you might want to call.  Using the /inject refinement you can
	run some code after the program has executed but before the environment is disposed.
	
	For instance, the following example uses a shorthand format for defining a function that 
	triples a number and saving it in t:
	
		>> rebmu [Ta|[a*3]]
	
	But defining the function isn't enough to call it, so if you had wanted to do that you
	could have said:
	
		>> rebmu/inject [Ta|[a*3]] [wT10]
		30
		
	The injected code is just shorthand for [w t 10], where w is writeout-mu, a variation of
	Rebol's print.
	}
	
	History: [
		0.1.0 [10-Jan-2010 {Sketchy prototype written to cover only the
		Roman Numeral example I worked through when coming up with the
		idea.  So very incomplete, more a proof of concept.} "Fork"]
		
		0.2.0 [22-Jun-2010 {Language more complete, includes examples.
		Ditched concept of mushing symbols like + and - into single
		character operators is removed due to realization that A+
		B+ C+ etc. are more valuable in the symbol space than one
		character for AD.}]
		
		0.3.0 [24-Jun-2010 {Made backwards compatible with Rebol 2.  Note
		that things like CN for continue or percentage! datatype operations
		were added in Rebol 3.  You can use these in your Rebmu programs
		but they will only work if using Rebmu with an r3 interpreter.}]

	;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	; WHAT REBOL DEFINES BY DEFAULT IN THE TWO-CHARACTER SPACE
	;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
	; Very Reasonable Use of English Words
	
	; TO	to conversion
	; OR	or operator
	; IN	word or block in the object's context
	; IF	conditional if
	; DO	evaluates a block, file, url, function word
	; AT	returns the series at the specified index
	; NO	logic false
	; ON	logic true

	; Reasonable use of Symbolic Operators

	; ++	increment and return previous value
	; --	decrement and return previous value
	; ??	Debug print a word, path, block or such
	; >=	true if the first value is greater than the second
	; <>	true if the values are not equal
	; <=	true if the first value is less than the second
	; =?	true if the values are identical
	; //	remainder of first value divided by second
	; **	first number raised to the power of the second
	; !=	true if the values are not equal

	; Maybe reasonable use of abbreviation in the default.  Could be carriage-return
	; and line-feed and leave it to the user to abbreviate.
	
	; CR	carraige return character
	; LF	line feed character

	; Questionable shorthands for terms defined elsewhere. Considering how many things do
	; not have shorthands by default...what metric proved that *these four* were the
	; ideal things to abbreviate?  They are only in Rebol 3.
	
	; SP	alias for SPACE
	; RM	alias for DELETE
	; DP	alias for DELTA-PROFILE
	; DT	alias for DELTA-TIME

	; These are shell commands and it seems like there would be many more.	Could there
	; be a shell dialect, in which for instance issue values (#foo) could be environment
	; variables, or something like that?  It seems many other things would be nice, like
	; pushing directories or popping them, moving files from one place to another, etc. 
	
	; LS	print contents of a directory
	; CD	change directory

	; Another abbreviation that seems better to leave out
	; DS	temporary stack debug
	
	;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	; DATATYPE SHORTHANDS (3 CHARS)
	; Though I considered giving the datatypes 2-character names, I decided on 3 and saving
	; the one-characters for things like index? and offset? and length?	 Literal words
	; for types will probably not be showing up too often in Code Golf.
	;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

; Having trouble getting this to work programmatically in a way that doesn't require
; passing in the query function but uses the stem, e.g. "email" => "em" and do the
; binding.	Think it's due to bugs in R3A99.  Workaround I pass the query function in.

	(remap-datatype email! "em")
	(remap-datatype block! "bl")
	(remap-datatype char! "ch")
	(remap-datatype decimal! "dc")
	(remap-datatype error! "er")
	(remap-datatype function! "fn")
	(remap-datatype get-word! "gw")
	(remap-datatype paren! "pn")
	(remap-datatype integer! "in")
	(remap-datatype pair! "pr")
	; no percent! type in Rebol2
	(unless unset? get/any 'percent! [remap-datatype percent! "pc"])
	(remap-datatype closure! "cl")
	(remap-datatype logic! "lg") 
	(remap-datatype map! "mp")
	(remap-datatype none! "nn")
	; no object or to-object in Rebol2... so we skip based on missing "object" keyword
	; even thought the object! type exists
	(unless unset? get/any 'object [remap-datatype object! "ob"]) 
	(remap-datatype path! "pa")
	(remap-datatype lit-word! "lw")
	(remap-datatype refinement! "rf")
	(remap-datatype string! "st")
	(remap-datatype time! "tm")
	(remap-datatype tuple! "tu")
	(remap-datatype file! "fi") 
	(remap-datatype word! "wd")
	(remap-datatype tag! "tg") 
	(remap-datatype money! "mn")
	(remap-datatype binary! "bi")

	;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	; TYPE CONVERSION SHORTHANDS
	; These are particularly common and there aren't many commands starting with T
	; So aliasing them is useful.  May reconsider this later.  Also, these are special
	; variations that add behaviors for types unsupported by Rebol's operators.
