	Type: dialect
	Level: advanced
	
	Usage: { The Rebmu language is a dialect of Rebol which uses some unusual tricks to
	achieve smaller character counts in source code.  The goal is to make it easier to
	participate in programming challenges which attempt to achieve a given task in as few
	characters as possible.
	
	One of the main ways this is achieved is to use alternations of uppercase and lowercase
	letters to compress words in the source.  This is central to the Rebmu concept of
	"mushing" and "unmushing":

		>> unmush [abcDEFghi]
		== [abc def ghi]

	The choice to start a sequence of alternations with an uppercase letter is used as a special
	indicator of wishing the first element in the sequence to be interpreted as a set-word:
	
		>> unmush [ABCdefGHI]
		== [abc: def ghi]
	
	This applies to elements of paths as well.  Each path break presents an opportunity for
	a new alternation sequence, hence a set-word split:
	
		>> unmush [ABCdef/GHI]    
		== [abc: def/ghi:]

		>> unmush [ABCdef/ghi]
		== [abc: def/ghi]

	An exception to this rule are literal words, where since you cannot make a literal
	set-word in source the purpose is to allow you to indicate whether the *next* word
	should be a set-word.  Choosing lowercase for the lit word will mean the next word
	is a set-word, while uppercase means it will not be:
	
		>> unmush [abc'DEFghi]
		== [abc 'def ghi]

		>> unmush [abc'defGHI] 
		== [abc 'def ghi:]
		
	Despite being a little bit "silly" (as Code Golf is sort of silly), there is
	a serious side to the design.  Rebmu is a genuine dialect... meaning that it
	uses the Rebol data format and thus relegates most parsing--such as parentheses
	and block matches.  This means that there's no string-oriented trickery taking
	advantage of illegal source token sequences in Rebol (like 1FOO, A:B, A$B...)
	
	Also, Rebmu is a superset of Rebol, so any Rebol code should be able to be used
	safely.  That's because despite several shorthands defined for common Rebol operations 
	(even as far as I for IF) the functions are true to their Rebol bretheren across 
	all inputs that Rebol accepts.  [Current exceptions to this are q and ?]
	
	Rebmu programs get their own execution context.  They will unmush their input,
	set up the environment of abbreviated routines, and run the code:
	
		>> rebmu [w"Hello World"]
		Hello World
	    
	You can also pass in named arguments via a block:
	
		>> rebmu/args [wSwM] [s: "Hello" m: "World"]
		Hello
		World
		
	Or you can pass in a block which does not begin with a set-word and that block will
	appear in the execution context as the variable a:
	
		>> rebmu/args [wA] [1 2 3]
		1 2 3
	
	You can run your Rebmu program and let it set some values in its environment, such
	as defining functions you might want to call.  Using the /inject refinement you can
	run some code after the program has executed but before the environment is disposed.
	
	For instance, the following example uses a shorthand format for defining a function that 
	triples a number and saving it in t:
	
		>> rebmu [T|[a*3]]
	
	But defining the function isn't enough to call it, so if you had wanted to do that you
	could have said:
	
		>> rebmu/inject [T|[a*3]] [wT10]
		30
		
	The injected code is just shorthand for [w t 10], where w is writeout-mu, a variation of
	Rebol's print.
	}

        Roman Numeral example I worked through when coming up with the
        idea.  So very incomplete, more a proof of concept.} "Fork"]

	;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	; WHAT REBOL DEFINES BY DEFAULT IN THE TWO-CHARACTER SPACE
	;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
	; Very Reasonable Use of English Words
	
	; TO 	to conversion
	; OR	or operator
	; IN	word or block in the object's context
	; IF	conditional if
	; DO	evaluates a block, file, url, function word
	; AT	returns the series at the specified index
	; NO	logic false
	; ON	logic true

	; Reasonable use of Symbolic Operators

	; ++ 	increment and return previous value
	; -- 	decrement and return previous value
	; ??	Debug print a word, path, block or such
	; >=	true if the first value is greater than the second
	; <>	true if the values are not equal
	; <=	true if the first value is less than the second
	; =?	true if the values are identical
	; //	remainder of first value divided by second
	; **	first number raised to the power of the second
	; !=	true if the values are not equal

	; Questionable shorthands for terms defined elsewhere. Considering how many things do
	; not have shorthands by default...what metric proved that *these four* were the
	; ideal things to abbreviate? 
	
	; SP 	alias for SPACE
	; RM	alias for DELETE
	; DP	alias for DELTA-PROFILE
	; DT	alias for DELTA-TIME

	; These are shell commands and it seems like there would be many more.  Could there
	; be a shell dialect, in which for instance issue values (#foo) could be environment
	; variables, or something like that?  It seems many other things would be nice, like
	; pushing directories or popping them, moving files from one place to another, etc.	
	
	; LS	print contents of a directory
	; CD	change directory

	; Another abbreviation that seems better to leave out
	; DS	temporary stack debug
	
	;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	; DATATYPE SHORTHANDS (3 CHARS)
	; Though I considered giving the datatypes 2-character names, I decided on 3 and saving
	; the one-characters for things like index? and offset? and length?  Literal words
	; for types will probably not be showing up too often in Code Golf.

; Having trouble getting this to work programmatically in a way that doesn't require
; passing in the query function but uses the stem, e.g. "email" => "em" and do the
