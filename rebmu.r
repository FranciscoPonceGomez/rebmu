	Type: dialect
	Level: advanced
	
	Usage: { The Rebmu language is a dialect of Rebol which uses some unusual tricks to
	achieve smaller character counts in source code.  The goal is to make it easier to
	participate in programming challenges which attempt to achieve a given task in as few
	characters as possible.
	
	One of the main ways this is achieved is to use alternations of uppercase and lowercase
	letters to compress words in the source.  This is central to the Rebmu concept of
	"mushing" and "unmushing":

		>> unmush [abcDEFghi]
		== [abc def ghi]

	The choice to start a sequence of alternations with an uppercase letter is used as a special
	indicator of wishing the first element in the sequence to be interpreted as a set-word:
	
		>> unmush [ABCdefGHI]
		== [abc: def ghi]
	
	This applies to elements of paths as well.  Each path break presents an opportunity for
	a new alternation sequence, hence a set-word split:
	
		>> unmush [ABCdef/GHI]    
		== [abc: def/ghi:]

		>> unmush [ABCdef/ghi]
		== [abc: def/ghi]

	An exception to this rule are literal words, where since you cannot make a literal
	set-word in source the purpose is to allow you to indicate whether the *next* word
	should be a set-word.  Choosing lowercase for the lit word will mean the next word
	is a set-word, while uppercase means it will not be:
	
		>> unmush [abc'DEFghi]
		== [abc 'def ghi]

		>> unmush [abc'defGHI] 
		== [abc 'def ghi:]
		
	Despite being a little bit "silly" (as Code Golf is sort of silly), there is
	a serious side to the design.  Rebmu is a genuine dialect... meaning that it
	uses the Rebol parser and does not a custom string format.  Also, despite several
	shorthands defined for common Rebol operations (even as far as I for IF) the
	functions are true to their Rebol bretheren for all inputs that Rebol accepts.
	Hence one does not have to re-learn the meaning of such constructs to use
	Rebol in its unadulterated form!
	
	Rebmu programs get their own execution context.  They will unmush their input,
	set up the environment of abbreviated routines, and run the code:
	
		>> rebmu [p"Hello World"]
		Hello World
	    
	You can also pass in named arguments via a block:
	
		>> rebmu/args [pMpN] [m: "Hello" n: "World"]
		Hello
		World
		
	If you want to run your Rebmu program and let it set some values in its environment, such
	as defining functions you might want to call, you can also use the /inject refinement to
	run some code after the program has run but before the environment is disposed.
	
	For instance, the following example uses a shorthand format for defining a function that 
	triples a number:
	
		>> rebmu [Tf'x[x*3]]
	
	But defining the function isn't enough to call it, so if you had wanted to do that you
	could have said:
	
		>> rebmu/inject [Tf'x[x*3]] [pT10]
		30
		
	The injected code is just shorthand for [p t 10], where p is equal to print.
	}
