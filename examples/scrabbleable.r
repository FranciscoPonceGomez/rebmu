; we use the space constant a lot, so it's worth it to define s to be space

; N is the number of input strings
Nl?A
   
; L is our longest string length
L0feZa[LmxLl?Z]

; V is our board size
; expression is V(1 + (l - 1) * (ad eOD?n1[0] dv n 2)])
; we add one because our loop doesn't do the theoretical minimum ++ v

; M is our VxV board matrix, initially set to spaces 
Mai^Vs^Vs
	
; G is a func (not a funct) thus can write to the global variable M 
; it takes a matrix to replace the matrix with and returns the old one

; F is the now common iterator finder for coordinates in a matrix
; modified so if you ask about out of range it always returns space

; T is a "c|function", meaning it takes parameters A B C
; it tries to put the string A into the matrix at coordinates B with step offset C
; returns true if successful false if not
; NOTES: as written, will corrupt the board in the case of a failure, so save a copy
; (for horizontal placemement C = [1 0] and vertical placement C = [0 1])
; rule is that any non-space must match the word we're putting down
; also at least one such collision must happen for a true result
; (ignored by the first word placement)
; also we cannot make a continuation of an existing word
; (before first letter and after last must be space or board edge)
; points opposite a collision may be occupied on the other axis, but if there's
; not a collision then those points must be spaces
