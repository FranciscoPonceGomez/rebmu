; read J from the user, this is our height which will be greater than 1
; NOTE: if we are using rebmu/args we'd do JfsA
rJ

; read N from the user, this is our percentage sand
; NOTE: if we are using rebmu/args we'd do NscA
; NOTE: Percentages are a new type introduced in Rebol 3, this won't work in Rebol 2
N 0% rN

; Here's a doomsday hourglass... it tells you how much of your life is left until 21-dec-2012
; Demonstrates how native Rebol code can be used natively right smack dab in the middle of Rebmu.

; top line width is what we get when add 1 to the result of multiplying j * 2

; S is a string whose elements correspond to:
;
; 1: what to print if there's no volume and it's the last row
; 2: left boundary of hourglass
; 3: sand
; 4: right boundary of hourglass
; 5: what to print when there is no volume and it's not the last row
;
; Reversing it makes it work for the bottom half when you change the first 
; character to an underscore
S{ \x/ }

; D is how far we are currently inDented during a print
D0

; Hourglass func takes three parameters...
; A is the limit for the draw
; B is the count of the volume of *spaces* to draw before we start drawing X characters
; C is our offset (-1 for top half, 1 for bottom)
