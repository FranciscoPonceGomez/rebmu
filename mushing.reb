    Description: {

    Routines implementing the concept of "mushing".  Mushed Rebol still
    passes the parser but uses particular sequences of upper and lower
    case terms and symbol processing within words to achieve approximately
    40% reduction in the average character count of the abbreviated form:

        >> unmush [abcDEFghi]
        == [abc def ghi]

    The choice to start a sequence of alternations with an uppercase run
    is used as a special indicator of wishing the first element in the
    sequence to be interpreted as a set-word:

        >> unmush [ABCdefGHI]
        == [abc: def ghi]

    This applies to elements of paths as well.  Each path break presents
    an opportunity for a new alternation sequence, hence a set-word split:

        >> unmush [ABCdef/GHI]
        == [abc: def/ghi:]

        >> unmush [ABCdef/ghi]
        == [abc: def/ghi]

    An exception to this rule are literal words, where since you cannot
    make a literal set-word in source the purpose is to allow you to
    indicate whether the *next* word should be a set-word.  Choosing
    lowercase for the lit word will mean the next word is a set-word,
    while uppercase means it will not be:

        >> unmush [abc'DEFghi]
        == [abc 'def ghi]

        >> unmush [abc'defGHI]
        == [abc 'def ghi:]

    A get-word! cannot be made inline like this, because colons are
    used in URL types (even a:b is a url!).  But in the one case of
    leading colons, the same rule applies to the capitalization,
    indicating whether the second word will be a set-word or not:

        >> unmush [:abcDEFghi]
        == [:abc def: ghi]

        >> unmush [:ABCdefGHI]
        == [:abc def ghi]

    A source-level set-word might seem to most sensibly make the
    last run a set-word.  But if you want [abc: def ghi:] then it is
    just as many characters to write [ABCdef GHI] as [ABCdefGHI:],
    so a cooler gimmick is needeed

        TBD: what cool trick should this enable?

    Because symbols do not have a "case" they are handled specially.
    Since Rebmu tries to be compatible with Rebol code (as long as it's
    all lowercase!) they generally act like lowercase letters, with a few
    caveats:

        ; lowercase run to another lowercase, will act lowercase
        [a+b] => [a+b]

        ; implied lowercase, again compatible with ordinary Rebol
        [+b] => [+b]

        ; uppercase run to another uppercase, splits symbol out
        [A+B] => [a: + b]

        ; switching lower to upper, symbol binds to the tail of first
        [a+B] => [a+ b]

        ; switching upper to lower, symbol binds to the head of second
        [A+b] => [a: +b]

        ; all one token, has to be compatible with ordinary Rebol
        [a++b] => [a++b]

        ; surprise!  multiple symbols bind into their own token
        [A++b] => [a: ++ b]

        ; caps after a multi symbol break starts a new word
        [a++B] => [a ++ b]

        ; pursuant to the above
        [A++B] => [a: ++ b]

    Digits are handled mostly the same as symbols, in that they will
    bind in a word as a single digit but stand alone in larger
    groups.  This makes initializations easy:

        [A10B20C00] => [a: 10 b: 20 c: 0]

    There is a difference from symbol, when you switch from upper to
    lowercase across a single digit.  It would not make sense for it
    to bind to the head of the next symbol (invalid integer) so 
    instead it sticks to the left:

        [A0b] => [a0: b]

    It's important to notice that unless there is an uppercase letter
    *somewhere* in your words, the mushing will not be applied.  So
    the mushing rules wouldn't apply in this case, for instance:

        [a00] => [a00]

    The number of spaces and colons this can save on in Rebol code is
    significant, and it is easy to read and write once the rules are
    understood.  If you know Rebol, that is :)

    This file might be expanded to include an automatic mushing routine
    However, it is important to bear in mind that the point of Rebmu
    is to provide a language which despite achieving a low character
    count is still fairly feasible to code in without using an assistive
    mechanical preprocessor or compiler.
